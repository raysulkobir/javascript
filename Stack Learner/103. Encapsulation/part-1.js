// The JavaScript Encapsulation is a process of binding the data (i.e. variables) with the functions acting on that data. It allows us to control the data and validate it. To achieve an encapsulation in JavaScript: -

// Use var keyword to make data members private.
// Use setter methods to set the data and getter methods to get that data.
// The encapsulation allows us to handle an object using the following properties:

// Read/Write - Here, we use setter methods to write the data and getter methods read that data.

// Read Only - In this case, we use getter methods only.
